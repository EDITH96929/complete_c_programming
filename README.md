# Complete C Programming ðŸš€  

This repository is created as part of an **assignment task** given by **Centurion University of Technology and Management**. The objective of this assignment is to implement various C programs covering fundamental to advanced concepts and push them to **GitHub** for version control and collaborative learning.  

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure  
The repository is structured into multiple categories based on different C programming concepts:  


- **basic1** - Fundamental C programs (input/output, variables, data types)  
- **controlFlow2** - Programs related to conditional statements and loops (if-else, switch, for, while, do-while)  
- **patternProgram3** - Star, number, and character pattern programs  
- **function4** - Functions, recursion, and modular programming  
- **arrays5** - One-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays  
- **Strings6** - String handling functions and operations  
- **Conversions7** - Programs for unit and number system conversions  
- **Pointers8** - Pointer concepts including pointer arithmetic and dynamic memory allocation  
- **FileIO10** - File handling operations (reading, writing, appending)  
- **DateandTime11** - Programs related to date and time manipulation  
- **StructuresandUnions** - Implementation of structures, unions, and typedef  
- **MoreCPrograms** - Miscellaneous C programs beyond the categorized topics
